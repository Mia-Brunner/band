  <p>
    The Spice Girls broke onto the music scene at a time when alternative rock, hip-hop and R&B dominated global music
    charts. The modern pop phenomenon that the Spice Girls created by targeting early members of Generation Y was
    credited with changing the global music landscape,[133][134][135] bringing about the global wave of late 1990s and
    early 2000s teen pop acts such as Hanson, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and NSYNC.
